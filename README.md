## Environment Variables

Ensure you have the following environment variables set in your `.env` file:

- `SECRET_KEY`: Django secret key for your application.
- `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`: Password for your email host user.
- `DEBUG`: Set to `True` for development and `False` for production.
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Comma-separated list of hosts allowed to serve the application.

## Usage

- Access the admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin`
- Use the created superuser credentials to log in.
- Manage users, announcements, and other models via the admin interface.

## API Endpoints

The application provides several API endpoints for interacting with the models. Some of the key endpoints include:

- `POST /register/`: Register a new user.
- `POST /login/`: Log in a user and obtain a token.
- `GET /utilisateurs/`: List all users.
- `GET /annonces/`: List all announcements.
- `POST /reset_password/`: Request a password reset.

Refer to the `urls.py` and `views.py` files for more details on available endpoints and their usage.

## Customization

### Admin Interface Customization

The admin interface uses Jazzmin for enhanced UI. You can further customize it by modifying the `JAZZMIN_SETTINGS` in `settings.py`.

### Static and Media Files

- Static files are served from the `static` directory.
- Media files are uploaded to the `media` directory.

Ensure the paths are correctly set up in the `settings.py`:

```python
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
]
```
